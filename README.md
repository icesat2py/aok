## Team members

We encourage all active team members with repository access to work directly on their own branch, creating one branch for each "task" they are working on.
This makes it easy for others to access their work and to keep things updated.
If you are in need of a more personalized scratch space, please fork the repository to your personal GitHub account.

## Everyone
